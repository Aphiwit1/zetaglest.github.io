<p>
  Lua is the scripting language used in ZetaGlest's scenarios. It allows
  scenarios to expand and do things not normally possible in regular
  games of ZetaGlest. This page lists all the Lua commands available in
  ZetaGlest. For information on how to create scenarios and working with
  Lua in general, see Lua.

<p>
  Note: You canâ€™t use the <pre><-operator</pre> in within the XML-events. You can
  use an external script instead or invert the logic.
